                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>During your first visit, our expert physiotherapist will conduct a comprehensive assessment. This includes discussing your medical history, current symptoms, and goals. We'll perform a physical examination to evaluate your condition. Based on this assessment, we'll develop a personalised treatment plan tailored to your specific needs and explain the proposed course of action.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>In New Zealand, you generally don't need a referral to see a physiotherapist for private treatment. You can book an appointment directly with us. However, if you're seeking treatment for an ACC-covered injury, you may need a referral from your GP or specialist. If you're unsure, give us a call, and we'll be happy to guide you through the process.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We recommend wearing comfortable, loose-fitting clothing that allows easy access to the area being treated. For lower body issues, shorts or loose trousers are ideal. For upper body concerns, a tank top or loose shirt works well. If you're coming directly from work, don't worry - we can provide gowns or shorts if needed.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>A typical physiotherapy session at Total Body Physio lasts between 30 to 60 minutes, depending on the nature and complexity of your condition. Initial consultations may take longer as they include a comprehensive assessment. We ensure that each session provides sufficient time for treatment and any necessary education or exercise instruction.</p>

                    <p>Booking an appointment is easy! You can use our online booking system, which is available 24/7, or give us a call during business hours. Our friendly staff will be happy to assist you in finding a suitable time slot.</p>

                    <p>We understand that sometimes plans change. We kindly ask for at least 24 hours' notice if you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment. Late cancellations or no-shows may incur a $40 fee. You can cancel by phone, email, or replying to your confirmation SMS.</p>

                    <p>An ACC appointment is a physiotherapy session covered by the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) in New Zealand. If you've been injured in an accident, ACC may cover part or all of your treatment costs. We can help you navigate the ACC process and provide the necessary treatment for your injury.</p>
